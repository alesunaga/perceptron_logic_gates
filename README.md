# perceptron_logic_gates
This script demonstrates how a Perceptron, a fundamental building block of neural networks, # can be used to model basic logic gates: AND, OR, and XOR. # It visualizes the input data, trains the Perceptron for each gate, evaluates its performance, # and generates heatmaps to illustrate the decision boundary of the trained model.
